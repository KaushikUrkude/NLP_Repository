# NLP Basics Repository

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks covering essential techniques and concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It’s designed to help beginners understand and implement foundational NLP steps, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and various vectorization techniques.


## Content
Each notebook in this repository explores a different NLP technique:

**Tokenization - Splitting text into individual words or tokens**
