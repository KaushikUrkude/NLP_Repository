# NLP Basics Repository

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks covering essential techniques and concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It’s designed to help beginners understand and implement foundational NLP steps, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and various vectorization techniques.


## Content
Each notebook in this repository explores a different NLP technique:

**Tokenization - Splitting text into individual words or tokens**  
1.NLP_Tokenization.ipynb

**Stemming - Reducing words to their base or root form**  
2_Stemming_NLP.ipynb

**Lemmatization - Grouping words based on their dictionary form**  
3_Lemmatization_NLP.ipynb

**Stopwords Removal - Filtering out common words that don’t carry significant meaning**<br/>
4_Stopwords_NLP.ipynb

**Vectorization Techniques:<br/>**
**Bag of Words - Converting text into a frequency-based vector representation**<br/>
5_1_Vectorization_Bag__of_words.ipynb

**N-gram Bag of Words - Representing text with consecutive word combinations<br/>**
5_2_Vectorization_Bag__of_words_N_gram.ipynb

**TF-IDF - Transforming text based on term frequency and inverse document frequency<br/>**
5_3_Vectorization_TF_IDF_NLP.ipynb

**Parts of Speech Tagging - Identifying grammatical parts of each word in a sentence<br/>**
6_Parts_of_Speech_NLP.ipynb

**Word2Vec - Embedding words based on contextual similarity<br/>**
7_Word2Vec_NLP.ipynb

**Word Embedding Techniques - Overview of various word representation methods<br/>**
8_Word_embedding_Techniques_NLP.ipynb
