##NLP Basics Repository
This repository contains the basic building steps for fundamental techniques in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Each Jupyter notebook covers an essential NLP technique, providing a hands-on introduction to these concepts.<br/>

##Content
Each notebook in this repository explores a different NLP technique:

**Tokenization - Splitting text into individual words or tokens**
