NLP Basics Repository
This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks covering essential techniques and concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). It’s designed to help beginners understand and implement foundational NLP steps, including tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and various vectorization techniques.

Contents
Each notebook in this repository explores a different NLP technique:

Tokenization - Splitting text into individual words or tokens
1.NLP_Tokenization.ipynb
Stemming - Reducing words to their base or root form
2_Stemming_NLP.ipynb
Lemmatization - Grouping words based on their dictionary form
3_Lemmatization_NLP.ipynb
Stopwords Removal - Filtering out common words that don’t carry significant meaning
4_Stopwords_NLP.ipynb
Vectorization Techniques:
Bag of Words - Converting text into a frequency-based vector representation
5_1_Vectorization_Bag__of_words.ipynb
N-gram Bag of Words - Representing text with consecutive word combinations
5_2_Vectorization_Bag__of_words_N_gram.ipynb
TF-IDF - Transforming text based on term frequency and inverse document frequency
5_3_Vectorization_TF_IDF_NLP.ipynb
Parts of Speech Tagging - Identifying grammatical parts of each word in a sentence
6_Parts_of_Speech_NLP.ipynb
